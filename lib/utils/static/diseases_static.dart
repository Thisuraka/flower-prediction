    description:
        "Black rot disease, at its initial stage, presents as subtle but crucial symptoms on various plants, primarily affecting cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, and kale. In stage 1, infected plants display small, dark spots or lesions on their leaves, resembling tiny black specks. These spots are the first signs of trouble and can easily be overlooked. However, they mark the beginning of a potentially devastating disease that, if left unchecked, can lead to extensive damage and loss in agricultural crops. Early detection and intervention are essential in managing black rot disease and preserving crop health.",

        "Remember that the effectiveness of these treatments may vary depending on the severity of the disease and your specific growing conditions. If the disease progresses beyond Stage 1 or becomes unmanageable, consult with a local agricultural extension office or a plant disease specialist for further guidance and potential chemical control options.",

    description:
        "In the second stage of black rot disease, the situation intensifies as the initial small black spots on the plant leaves expand and develop a characteristic V-shaped pattern. These lesions extend deeper into the leaf tissue, turning brown and causing the affected areas to wither and die. As the disease progresses, the leaves become increasingly brittle and susceptible to breakage. At this point, it becomes more evident that black rot can have a significant impact on crop yield, making timely and effective management measures even more critical to mitigate its devastating effects. A treatment plan for black rot disease at stage 2 involves a combination of cultural, chemical, and preventive measures to manage the disease and protect your crops",
